Technical Ideas
Nightly scheduled task that pulls in updated csvs from quandl and runs a bunch of possible models, then gives advice for current day based on best model to put in orders for next business day.

All model ideas below should be able to be fine tuned at the same time. And then automate running of all possible models.



Model Ideas
Personal investment project
move results from csv to mysql table, and only run a trial if it doesn't exist in the table (save time) =
write a script that pulls the best strategy from 2005 to 2016, 1990 to 2016, and 1970 to 2016 and see if they are the same strategy

write script that pulls for each of the 3 time periods and writes to csv file in order of end balance.

days try 25-35 (10 possibilities) - in progress
rates try -10 to -20 (10 possibilities) - in progress
percentage - try .15 to .25 (10 possibilities) - in progress

use adjusting ratios of monthly stock investment
buy short and long term treasury bonds (buy some when stock market is at 30-60 day rallies, play with these intervals later) 
buy gold based on performance metric (buy some when stock market is at 30-60 day rallies, play with these intervals later)

Linear relationship between performance on one day and performance on the next day of S and P
also impact of 2 same days in a row (up or down) on next day

try to hit the sweet spot of when to sell gold after s and p goes down over time

run from 2005 to 2016, 1990 to 2016, and 1970 to 2016
