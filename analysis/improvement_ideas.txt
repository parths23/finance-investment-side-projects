Technical Ideas
Nightly scheduled task that pulls in updated csvs from quandl and runs a bunch of possible models, then gives advice for current day based on best model to put in orders for next business day.

All model ideas below should be able to be fine tuned at the same time. And then automate running of all possible models.



Model Ideas
Pick different markers of S and P and Gold that allow you to go before 2005

adjust ratio of monthly investment in gold vs s and p

adjust rebalancing based on performance (one tier, multiple tiers, what ratios?)

adjust two way investment (invest in gold from s and p?)

adjust performance time periods (not only prior 30 days)
